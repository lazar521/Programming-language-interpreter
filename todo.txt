-Make separate modules for semantic checking (type checking and stuff)
-When parser encounters an error and it starts skipping tokens it can skip a '{' ,for example, and then cannot match '}' later
-Probably should add an Expr node just for identifiers so that I can execute them by looking at the symbol table and fetching the value;
-Add assign operation into interpreter
-Maybe make separate visitor for Expr, Stmt and Decl statements
-Implement scopes
