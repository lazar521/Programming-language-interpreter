-When parser encounters an error and it starts skipping tokens it can skip a '{' ,for example, and then cannot match '}' later
-Add assign operation into interpreter
-Check if the parser is well written
-Move TType to DataType conversions into Parser class
-Remove some Expr and Stmt AST classes like Enclosed for example
-Write a better astPrinter

-Maybe i should provide only basic funcitonalities in the DeclarationTable class without throwing an error, and just move over the checking into Environment class
 but aside from that everything seems to work fine
